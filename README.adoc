## Aim

Provide an infrastructure to store and display telemetry at home.
This telemetry is mainly for fun (e.g. weather conditions, hardware monitoring)

## Run infrastructure

I use a raspberry pi 4 to run this but it is way more powerfull than required.
Beware this infrastrure can be write intensive so do not keep it writing on mmc or you will soon fry it.
In my case root partition is on a usb storage.

You will need docker installed

Then just run the `start_stack.sh`
First time it will complain about passwords you need to set.
Just add a file name `secrets.env` with all the variable it complains about (having set a value as you like).
Relaunch once you have chosen all the passwords
Enjoy

## Trouble shooting

### Volume manipulation 

Due to volume limitations we are to manipulate directory rights

- locate volume for grafana
  - change permissions
  - `chmod 775 -R ...`
  - `chown 472:472 -R ...`
- locate volume for mosquitto
  - change permissions
  - `chmod 775 -R ...`
  - `chown 1883:1883 -R ...`
- locate volume for nodered
  - change permissions
  - `chmod 775 -R ...`
  - `chown 1000:1000 -R ...`
